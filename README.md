# AIN2001-Assignment1
This assignment is borrowed from Project 1 of CS188 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence by Igor Mordatch & Peyrin Kao, Fall 2022, UC Berkeley: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa22/projects/proj1/. You can follow the steps that you need to complete in this assignment through either this document (recommended) or through the webpage provided by Mordatch and Kao. 

# Introduction
In this project, your Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios. This project includes an autograder for you to grade your answers on your machine. This can be run with the command:
```rb
python autograder.py
```
# Structure
The code for this project consists of several Python files, some of which you will need to read and understand in order to complete the assignment, and some of which you can ignore. All the code and supporting files are given inside ’./search’ folder

# Files to Edit and Submit
During the assignment, you will fill in portions of:
* search.py
* searchAgents.py

Once you have completed the assignment, you will submit:
* completed search.py
* completed searchAgents.py
* search.token generated by submission_autograder.py

# Evaluation
Submissions will be auto-graded using an evaluation script, which is similar to the given "autograder.py". Please do not change the names of any provided functions or classes within the code, or you will wreak havoc on the autograder.
